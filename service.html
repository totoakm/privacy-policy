        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 28, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>Friend Finder</strong> ("App", "Service"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our mobile application and services. By creating an account or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility & Account Creation</h2>
        <p>To use Friend Finder, you must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong>. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are at least 18 years of age.</li>
            <li>You have not been previously suspended or removed from our Service.</li>
            <li>You have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration, including your real name, date of birth, and a valid email address.</p>

        <h2>2. Safety & Verification</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Face Verification</h3>
        <p>To ensure the safety of our community and prevent fake accounts ("Catfishing"), we may require you to undergo a <strong>Face Verification</strong> process. This involves capturing a real-time selfie which is compared against your profile photos using biometric technology. Accounts that fail verification or are found to be impersonating others will be suspended.</p>
        
        <h3>2.2 Blue Badge Verification</h3>
        <p>Users may be awarded a "Blue Badge" indicating a verified status. This status is granted at our sole discretion based on identity verification and community trust scores.</p>

        <h2>3. Location Services</h2>
        <p><strong>Friend Finder is a location-first application.</strong> Our core functionality relies on your precise geolocation to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display the "People Nearby" list.</li>
            <li>Show active users in your vicinity.</li>
            <li>Calculate distances between users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You acknowledge that by enabling location services, your approximate distance (but not your exact address) may be visible to other users. You can disable location services in your device settings at any time, but this will limit the App's functionality.</p>

        <h2>4. User Conduct & Prohibited Content</h2>
        <p>You agree to use the App in a respectful and lawful manner. You strictly agree <strong>NOT</strong> to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Harass or Bully:</strong> Engage in harassment, intimidation, defamation, or hate speech against any user.</li>
            <li><strong>Post Illegal Content:</strong> Upload content that is illegal, violent, sexually explicit (pornography), or promotes self-harm.</li>
            <li><strong>Impersonate:</strong> Create false identities or use photos of others without permission.</li>
            <li><strong>Spam:</strong> Send unsolicited commercial messages or spam to other users.</li>
            <li><strong>Scrape Data:</strong> Use automated bots to collect user information.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Zero Tolerance Policy:</strong> We have a zero-tolerance policy for objectionable content and abusive behavior. Violation of these rules will result in immediate account termination.
        </div>

        <h2>5. Business Accounts & Marketplace</h2>
        <p>If you use our "Business" features to list products or services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your business information and product listings.</li>
            <li>You must comply with all local laws regarding the sale of goods and services.</li>
            <li>We do not process payments directly and are not a party to any transactions between users.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to remove any business listing that violates our policies (e.g., selling prohibited items).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property & Content Rights</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of the content (photos, bio, posts) you upload. However, by posting content, you grant Friend Finder a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, use, display, and distribute such content within the Service.</p>

        <h2>7. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms. You may also delete your account at any time via <em>Settings > Privacy & Security > Delete Account</em>. Upon deletion, your personal data will be removed from our active databases.</p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <h3>8.1 Real World Interactions</h3>
        <p>Friend Finder facilitates connections, but we do not control what happens offline. <strong>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users.</strong> We strongly advise you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use caution when sharing personal information.</li>
            <li>Meet in public places for the first time.</li>
            <li>Tell a friend or family member where you are going.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>8.2 "As Is" Service</h3>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not guarantee that the App will always be safe, secure, or error-free, or that it will function without disruptions.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes within the App. Continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding these Terms, please contact our support team at:</p>
